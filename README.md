# Multi-Thread

I implemented a multi-threaded program (using C++) on Linux that will perform several arithmetic operations in parallel. 

The program will have 4 different types of worker threads: multipliers, dividers, adders, and subtractors. Each of the worker threads perform the arithmetic operation indicated by its name. The program will receive an initial value (initVal) through command line. Then, the input file will list the number of workers of each type, and the amount they will do in their operation.
